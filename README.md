## Architecture

The application is built with a modular component architecture for maintainability and reusability:

- **Components**:
  - `Header` - Application title and branding
  - `ControlPanel` - Interactive controls for key, scale, mode, and notation selection
  - `KeyDisplay` - Real-time display of current key, relative key, and mode context
  - `Fretboard` - Dynamic SVG fretboard with responsive note bubble rendering
  - `Field` - Reusable form field wrapper component

- **Core Logic**:
  - `ScaleEngine` - Scale generation algorithms for all modes (3NPS, pentatonic, hexatonic, full neck)
  - `types` - TypeScript definitions and musical constants
